README for Sequencer64-packages

2017-04-19 to 2017-04-19

Sequencer64 is a reboot of seq24.  It extends seq24 in features and bug fixes;
the heart of seq24 remains intact.  See the sequencer64 project on GitHub:

    http://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64.git

This project provides 32-bit and 64-bit Debian packages of recent builds of
Sequencer64.

Please let us know if you find issues with these Debian packages.  If you have
a build for another version of Linux that you want to publish here, we will
happily host it.

Thanks!  Enjoy!
