README for Sequencer64-packages

Sequencer64 is a reboot of seq24.  It extends seq24 in features and bug fixes;
the heart of seq24 remains intact.  See the sequencer64 project on GitHub:

    http://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64.git

This project provides 32-bit and 64-bit Debian packages of recent builds of
Sequencer64.

Some users are finding issues installing the deb on KX Studio and other
music-specific distros.  The latest deb in the 0.93.3 directory is:

    sequencer64-kxstudio-ubuntu-14.04.5-LTS_0.93.3-0_amd64.deb

is meant to fix these issues, but please test it and let us know what happens.
It was build in a KX Studio VM and works in that VM when installed.

Please let us know if you find issues with these packages.  If you have
a build for another version of Linux that you want to publish here, we will
happily host it.

Thanks!  Enjoy!
